## Issue: Cannot Import Internal Packages

### Problem
The handler attempts to import `github.com/linearbits/dbadmin/internal/service/*` packages which are not importable from external modules because they are in the `internal/` directory.

### Error
```
handlers/dbadmin_handler.go:13:2: use of internal package github.com/linearbits/dbadmin/internal/service/audit not allowed
```

### Root Cause
Go's `internal` directory prevents importing these packages from outside the module. This is by design.

### Affected Imports
- `github.com/linearbits/dbadmin/internal/service/audit`
- `github.com/linearbits/dbadmin/internal/service/backup`
- `github.com/linearbits/dbadmin/internal/service/database`
- `github.com/linearbits/dbadmin/internal/service/migration`
- `github.com/linearbits/dbadmin/internal/service/tenant`

## Solutions

### Option 1: Move Services to Public Package (Recommended)
Move the service code from `internal/service` to `pkg/service` in dbadmin to make them importable.

### Option 2: Copy Service Files to Module
Copy the service files into the module and adapt imports.

### Option 3: Use Direct Database Calls (Simplest)
Replace service calls with direct database queries in the handler.

### Option 4: Create Service Interfaces
Create public interfaces in dbadmin that the module can use.

## Current Handler Status

The handler is structurally complete but cannot compile due to import restrictions.

## Next Steps

1. Choose a solution
2. Implement the fix
3. Re-test compilation
4. Verify functionality

## Impact

- **Handler**: Will not compile
- **Module**: Cannot be used as-is
- **Alternative**: Simplest approach is to implement direct database calls

## Recommendation

Use Option 3 (Direct Database Calls) for fastest resolution, or Option 1 if keeping service layer is important.
